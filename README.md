# Repository
>A boilerplate repository for JavaScript DevOps tools like LoDash, Async, Debug, etc.

## Problems

Creating repositories like LoDash, Neo-Async (& Async), BlueBird, in JavaScript is HUGE pain in the ass! A lot of time is spent working on things that are not the main repository. This repository will help get kickstarted with:

- **Documentation**
- **Unit Tests**
- **Benchmarks**
- **Licenses**
- **Code of Conducts**
- **Patronage**
- **Code Tranpiling** - _supporting older version of JavaScript_
- **Code Wrangling** - _shortening code and making it unreadable for production._
- **Node.js & Browser** Support - _effectively navigating the hell-hole that is module/package importing/exporting in JavaScript_
